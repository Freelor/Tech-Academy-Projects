        <h1>Types Of AI</h1>
        <p>     There are four types of artificial intelligence: reactive machines, limited memory, theory of mind and self-awareness.</p>
    </div>

        <h2>Reactive machines are basic in that they do not store 'memories' or use past experiences to determine future actions. They simply perceive the world and react to it. IBM's Deep Blue, which defeated chess grandmaster Kasporov, is a reactive machine that sees the pieces on a chess board and reacts to them</h2>
